# Training_Scripts
This repo will be for scripts designed to help with HTB/VHL/PWK.

Now includes python scripts. In order for this to be complete I still have to add in the ability for VHL and PWK labs. Unfortunately I no longer have access to PWK and do not have a VHL ovpn file to use. However, I would love input from anyone who would like to help.
